# Monacode 2023

The Monacode hackathon is a global, online hackathon for the Solana and wider web3 community with the goal of expanding and improving the prediction market & sports betting experience on the Monaco Protocol.&#x20;



## What is the Monaco Protocol?

The Monaco Protocol is an open source decentralized liquidity network for exchange-based applications built on the Solana blockchain. It serves as crucial infrastructure upon which third-party applications for wagering on binary outcome events can be built while accessing a shared liquidity pool. \


## What has already been built on the Monaco Protocol?

With total matched bets exceeding $2,000,000 to date, dozens of projects have already been deployed using the Monaco Protocol as its backbone. The most noticeable being the BetDEX Exchange, a peer-to-peer non-custodial sports betting exchange; PureBet, a betting aggregation engine; and DisBet, a Discord bot that places wagers directly on the Monaco Protocol.\


## Are there multiple tracks for the hackathon?

There are two different tracks for the hackathon; the first track is for all projects that fall under the category of betting exchanges & sportsbooks. The second track is for all other projects.

\


### What are the prizes?

#### Betting Exchange & Sportsbooks Track

Top prize $5,000 USDT (plus, three (3) hours of workshops\*)

2nd place $2,000 USDT (plus, one (1) one-hour workshop\*)

#### All Other Projects

Top prize $2,000 USDT (plus, one (1) one-hour workshop\*)\
2nd place $1,000 USDT (plus, one (1) one-hour workshop\*)



\*All non-cash prizes may be modified or withheld at Monaco Protocol Foundation’s discretion



## How long is the hackathon?

This hackathon will last from **Sept 4 - Oct 23, 2023**. Great products take time to build. The length of this hackathon is to encourage teams to build high-quality applications with long term viability. These seven weeks should allow for enough time to brainstorm ideas, gather your team, formulate a business idea, run, test & iterate your project.&#x20;



**Official Kickoff:** Monday Sept 4th 15:00 UTC

**Submission Deadline:** Monday Oct 23rd 15:30 UTC

### Kick-off and Office Hours

We will also be hosting a **kick-off event in Discord on Monday Sept, 4th, at 15:00 - 15:45 UTC**, to answer all your questions. We will also offer weekly office hours **every subsequent Monday 15:00 - 15:30 UTC** right the way up to submission closure. \


### 1:1 Sessions

If you want to discuss your project with a member of the Monaco Protocol team in a 1:1 session, you can email hackathon@monacoprotocol.xyz\


## Where can I learn more about the SDK?

* [Start Here](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/discussions/6) on DevHub is a great place to start and act as your base of operations. It provides a quick overview of where you need to go to get the right information.
* If this is your first time working on Solana, you’ll want to set yourself up with an RPC node so check out this [getting started guide](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples#getting-started---rpc-node) for getting a node through [https://www.helius.dev/](https://www.helius.dev/).
* Check out the [CLI examples](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples/cli) to get up and running quickly once you have your node set up, just point at the right environment and go!
*
  * With it you can view markets, market summaries, and place or cancel bets.
* For understanding some of the nuances of the protocol, be sure to check out [the deep dives](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/deep-dives).
* And why not check out the [market seeder tool](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/market-seeder) to see how you can programmatically add liquidity to betting markets?
* And of course, hop on over to Discord or leave a message on DevHub if you have any question at all - every question helps us make the SDK even better, so they are all welcome and encouraged.



## What RPC Infrastructure can we use?

Any RPC node provider you like, however if you're looking for a place to get started, check out our [guide on getting up and running with helius.dev](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples#getting-started---rpc-node):



## How will projects be judged?

Projects will be judged by members of the Monaco Protocol and Solana Foundation teams on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: functionality, usefulness, uniqueness, user experience, integration with the Monaco Protocol, commerciality (can this project be a viable business), quality of code, and bonus points awarded if the project is open-sourced.&#x20;



Winners of the event will be announced at Breakpoint 2023, at an IRL event and streamed online. More details on this event will be shared with all participants soon.&#x20;



## Do I need a licence to build on the Monaco Protocol?

The Monaco Protocol itself is simply the infrastructure and matching algorithm upon which other third-party applications can be built on, and thus is not subject to any licensing obligations. However, some of the applications built on top of the Monaco Protocol may be subject to certain licensing, depending on the application’s use and jurisdiction. The builders/developers of each individual application must assess and determine what, if any, laws, licensing and other regulatory requirements are applicable to the individual application.&#x20;

For any additional questions, or to request the opportunity to discuss the experiences of other builders on the Monaco Protocol in this regard (in their discretion), please contact hello@monacoprotocol.xyz.&#x20;



## Builder Ideas

\
While participants are encouraged to develop any projects of their choosing, here are some ideas to get you started:

#### Betting exchange or other prediction markets

Use the Monaco Protocol in its pureset form to offer bets on anything from sport to politics to weather.&#x20;

#### Sportsbook

Leverage the liquidity pools to offer a more traditional sportsbook experience.

#### Parlays/Accumulators

Central limit order books are a great platform for binary outcome wagers, yet they are limited in their ability to provide accumulator or parlay bets. Are there solutions which could allow parlay bets on decentralized CLOB platforms while maintaining high liquidity?&#x20;

#### Free-Bet Token Wrapper

Onboard and retain users by offering them a token which can be used to place a bet in lieu of USDT, on a USDT denominated market? (eg.a free one-time, risk-free, promotional bet where the user loses only the token if they lose the wager, but wins USDT if they win).&#x20;

#### Bounded AMM's

Build an automated market maker (AMM) on top of the Monaco Protocol to provide additional liquidity to the protocol?

#### Social betting

Is there a way to allow you and your friends to form a ‘syndicate’ and bet or form predictions in a transparent manner?

#### Enhance the sports betting UX

Could the UX be simplified to attract non-crypto natives to on-chain betting? How would that look for a sports betting user? How do you explain ‘self-custody’ or gas fees?&#x20;

#### Market Making Tools

Tools that can be created to allow users to inject liquidity into a programmatic manner onto a market. What inputs would be needed for the user (e.g. depth, volume, etc.)? How would the tools deal with price movements in the overall markets? How will it deal with liability?&#x20;

#### Oracle Integration

Integrate a price oracle into the Protocol for faster and a more streamlined market creation and market settlement process.

#### Analytics Dashboards

Dashboards to show protocol statistics like open liquidity, matched volume, total orders, P\&L exposure, etc.

#### VR/Mixed Reality Integration

Ready Player One?! Recreate the feel of a bookmakers shop or introduce the perfect 2nd screen experience for watching the game at home using mixed reality.

#### Tracking Bonus Abuse

Products to track users that are abusing certain rules, regulations or guidelines of operators? (Wash Trading, Wallets collusion, Etc.)

#### Leverage Illiquid Assets

Can a smart contract be created to hold NFT’s as collateral and lend based on the escrow?&#x20;

#### Analytical tools&#x20;

Tools to send instantaneous alerts on ‘high ROI’ wallet movements or ‘whale’ movements to subscribers; or a “smart money” tool to track wallets that have a higher propensity to win than average.

#### Transferable Bets

Got a long shot bet you want to gift to a friend? How can you fully transfer ownership of an order to send it to another wallet?

#### NFT Betslip

Your first bet, that big win, the crazy last-minute loss, sometimes you want the betslip for prosperity. How can you take key information from an order and save your betting memories forever?
