# Monacode 2023

The Monacode hackathon is a global, online hackathon for the Solana and wider web3 community with the goal of expanding and improving the prediction market & sports betting experience on the Monaco Protocol.&#x20;

## What is the Monaco Protocol?

The Monaco Protocol is an open source decentralized liquidity network for exchange-based applications built on the Solana blockchain. It serves as crucial infrastructure upon which third-party applications for wagering on binary outcome events can be built while accessing a shared liquidity pool.

## What has already been built on the Monaco Protocol?

With total matched bets exceeding $4,500,000 to date, dozens of projects have already been deployed using the Monaco Protocol as its backbone. The most noticeable being the BetDEX Exchange, a peer-to-peer non-custodial sports betting exchange; PureBet, a betting aggregation engine; and DisBet, a Discord bot that places wagers directly on the Monaco Protocol.

### What are the prizes?

* **Top prize** $5,000 USDT (plus, three (3) hours of workshops, and Introduction + Meeting with Paradigm + Meeting with Multicoin Capital\*)
* **2nd place** $3,000 USDT (plus, one (1) one-hour workshop\*)
* **3rd place** $2,000 USDT (plus, one (1) one-hour workshop\*)

\*All non-cash prizes may be modified or withheld at Monaco Protocol Foundation’s discretion.

## How long is the hackathon?

This hackathon will last from **Sept 4th - Oct 24th @ 00:00 UTC**. Great products take time to build. The length of this hackathon is to encourage teams to build high-quality applications with long term viability. These seven weeks should allow for enough time to brainstorm ideas, gather your team, formulate a business idea, run, test & iterate your project.&#x20;

**Official Kickoff:** Monday Sept 4th 15:00 UTC

**Submission Deadline:** Monday Oct 24th 00:00 UTC

* Github is there for you when you’re ready to jump into repositories. The SDK code lives here alongside the Protocol and other supporting repos: [https://github.com/MonacoProtocol](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol)
* Want to join our community & ask questions, then join our Discord: [https://discord.gg/bh5TbDAdcx](https://discord.gg/bh5TbDAdcx)

### Where can I ask technical questions?

* You can reach out to the Monaco Protocol Foundation on [Discord](https://discord.gg/bh5TbDAdcx) (channel: [#hackathon](https://discord.gg/FGAHWFUhGV)) to ask questions.
* You can post a question in [DevHub](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/discussions).&#x20;
* You can also email questions to: hackathon@monacoprotocol.xyz&#x20;

### Kick-off and Office Hours

We will also be hosting a **kick-off event on X-Spaces (Twitter) on Monday Sept, 4th, at 15:00 - 15:45 UTC**, to answer all your questions. We will also offer weekly office hours **every Monday 15:00 - 15:30 UTC.**

## 1:1 Sessions

If you want to discuss your project with a member of the Monaco Protocol team in a 1:1 session, you can email hackathon@monacoprotocol.xyz

## Where can I learn more about the SDK?

* [Start Here](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/discussions/6) on DevHub is a great place to start and act as your base of operations. It provides a quick overview of where you need to go to get the right information.
* If this is your first time working on Solana, you’ll want to set yourself up with an RPC node so check out this [getting started guide](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples#getting-started---rpc-node) for getting a node through [https://www.helius.dev/](https://www.helius.dev/).
* Check out the [CLI examples](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples/cli) to get up and running quickly once you have your node set up, just point at the right environment and go!
* With it you can view markets, market summaries, and place or cancel bets.
* For understanding some of the nuances of the protocol, be sure to check out [the deep dives](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/deep-dives).
* And why not check out the [market seeder tool](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/market-seeder) to see how you can programmatically add liquidity to betting markets?
* And of course, hop on over to Discord or leave a message on DevHub if you have any question at all - every question helps us make the SDK even better, so they are all welcome and encouraged.

## What RPC Infrastructure can we use?

Any RPC node provider you like, however if you're looking for a place to get started, check out our [guide on getting up and running with helius.dev](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/sdk/tree/main/examples#getting-started---rpc-node):

## How will projects be judged?

Projects will be judged by members of the Monaco Protocol foundation on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: functionality, usefulness, uniqueness, user experience, quality of code, and integration with the Monaco Protocol. Other key judging factors include the following:&#x20;

* **Quality of the Idea:** Creativity, originality, and code quality
* **Potential Value:** The extent to which the solution can be scaled and reach significant adoption
* **Implementation:** How well the idea is executed by the developers and the extent to which technology features of the Monaco Protocol was leveraged.

Winners of the event will be announced at Breakpoint 2023, at an IRL event and streamed online. More details on this event will be shared with all participants soon.

## Do I need a licence to build on the Monaco Protocol?

The Monaco Protocol itself is simply the infrastructure and matching algorithm upon which other third-party applications can be built on, and thus is not subject to any licensing obligations. However, some of the applications built on top of the Monaco Protocol may be subject to certain licensing, depending on the application’s use and jurisdiction. The builders/developers of each individual application must assess and determine what, if any, laws, licensing and other regulatory requirements are applicable to the individual application.&#x20;

For any additional questions, or to request the opportunity to discuss the experiences of other builders on the Monaco Protocol in this regard (in their discretion), please contact hello@monacoprotocol.xyz.&#x20;
