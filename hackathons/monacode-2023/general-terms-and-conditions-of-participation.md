## Submission

Any Participant’s solution and any other materials submitted in connection with the Hackathon will be referred to herein as your submission ("**Submission**"). Submissions may include code, project entry information, team participant information, demonstration videos, and documentation. Instructions will be provided on how to submit your project and check in the code for your prototype. We will accept only one Submission per registration. If a Participant wishes to submit multiple Submissions, it must create multiple registrations. Winning Participants may be subject to a code review at some point following the event or immediately before the winners are announced. Participants must complete its Submission before the end of the Hackathon.

Your Submission must: (i) adhere to the Terms and Rules of the Hackathon; (ii) not breach the terms and conditions of any embedded software or services used as part of your Submission, including any APIs and OSS licence terms (which you accept separately from this Hackathon when you choose to use); (iii) not contain any malicious code or backdoors; (iv) not contain, depict or refer to any crude, vulgar, obscene, sexually explicit, disparaging, discriminatory, offensive, illegal or otherwise unsuitable language, activity or other content (all as determined by Organiser in its sole discretion); (v) not contain, depict or refer to any content which disparages or refers negatively to Organiser, any of the judges or sponsors, the Hackathon, or any other person or entity (all as determined by Organiser in its sole discretion); and (vi) not contain any content that violates any law or any third party's rights (including privacy, personality and intellectual property rights).

All code developed as part of the Hackathon must be fresh, meaning that the portion that's included in the main source code repository has been developed explicitly for this Hackathon and that all existing dependent libraries are equally available to all participants.

## Judging

A panel of judges for each track will judge and select the winners by evaluating each Submission immediately after its demonstration using a combination of judging criteria. Each Submission will be judged, and final decisions of judges made, based on the judges' overall assessment of the following, non-exclusive, criteria:

* Quality of the Idea. Creativity, originality, and code quality
* Potential Value. The extent to which the solution can be scaled and reach significant adoption
* Implementation. How well the idea was executed by the developers and the extent to which technology features of the Monaco Protocol was leveraged.

The selection of the winning Submission will be at the sole direction of the judges and the decision(s) of the judges are final and not open to objection or appeal.

Judges are subject to change in Organiser's sole discretion. A judge may elect to recuse him or herself from evaluating a Submission, or Organiser may require a judge to recuse him or herself from evaluating a Submission, if, in the judge's or Organiser's discretion, it would not be appropriate for the judge to evaluate a Participant's Submission because of a past or current relationship with the Participant. Recusal decisions are final and not subject to appeal.

## Prizes and Winners

Potential winners will be announced shortly after the evaluation by the judges via E-Mail. Organiser may take any actions necessary to verify a Participant’s compliance with this Agreement before awarding a prize, including, without limitation, engaging a third-party vendor to evaluate the prototype software code or requiring a team to provide evidence of permission to use certain third-party materials or both. You acknowledge that even though you may be announced as a winner, if the Participant's compliance with this Agreement cannot be verified to the satisfaction of the Organiser, Organiser may select an alternate winner. Participants that are chosen as a winner may be asked to sign additional agreements related to prizes, travel, taxes, and appearances at events from the Organiser.

All prize details will be determined by the Organiser in its sole discretion. Organiser reserves the right to substitute a similar prize (or prize element) of comparable or greater value. All taxes and other expenses, costs, or fees associated with the acceptance or use of any prize or both are the sole responsibility of the winner. Prizes cannot be transferred or substituted by the winner. If a prize is not claimed within a reasonable time after notification from Organiser, as determined by Organiser in its sole discretion, it will be forfeited, and time permitting, an alternate winner may be selected from the remaining eligible Submissions at Organiser's sole discretion.

## Own application

Any Submission provided by any Participant should be conceptually original, non-existent and new and should be able to be implemented according to common and regular measures. Existing submissions are only to be used by integration into a new Submission. The Submission needs to be functional to be judged by the Jury.
