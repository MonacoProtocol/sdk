# Builder Ideas

The Monaco Protocol opens up a whole host of possibilities when it comes to building and innovation. Below are just some ways the Protocol could be leveraged.

## üì≤ Consumer Products

### Betting exchange or other prediction markets

Use the Monaco Protocol in its purest form to offer bets on anything from sport to politics to weather.&#x20;

### Sportsbook

Leverage the liquidity pools to offer a more traditional sportsbook experience.

### Free-Bet Token Wrapper

Onboard and retain users by offering them a token which can be used to place a bet in lieu of USDT, on a USDT denominated market? (eg.a free one-time, risk-free, promotional bet where the user loses only the token if they lose the wager, but wins USDT if they win).&#x20;

### Parlays/Accumulators

Central limit order books are a great platform for binary outcome wagers, yet they are limited in their ability to provide accumulator or parlay bets. Are there solutions which could allow parlay bets on decentralized CLOB platforms while maintaining high liquidity?&#x20;

### Social betting

Is there a way to allow you and your friends to form a ‚Äòsyndicate‚Äô and bet or form predictions in a transparent manner?

### Enhance the sports betting UX

Could the UX be simplified to attract non-crypto natives to on-chain betting? How would that look for a sports betting user? How do you explain ‚Äòself-custody‚Äô or gas fees?&#x20;



## üí∞ Liquidity Provisioning

### Market Making Tools

Tools that can be created to allow users to inject liquidity into a programmatic manner onto a market. What inputs would be needed for the user (e.g. depth, volume, etc.)? How would the tools deal with price movements in the overall markets? How will it deal with liability?&#x20;

To get started, check out our [example seeder](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/seed-calculator) in The Monaco Protocol GitHub, built using our [seed-calculator ](https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/seed-calculator)package.

### Bounded AMM's

Build an automated market maker (AMM) on top of the Monaco Protocol to provide additional liquidity to the protocol?



## üõ† Tools & Enhancements

### Oracle Integration

Integrate a price oracle into the Protocol for faster and a more streamlined market creation and market settlement process.

### Analytics Dashboards

Dashboards to show protocol statistics like open liquidity, matched volume, total orders, P\&L exposure, etc.

### VR/Mixed Reality Integration

Ready Player One?! Recreate the feel of a bookmakers shop or introduce the perfect 2nd screen experience for watching the game at home using mixed reality.

### Tracking Bonus Abuse

Products to track users that are abusing certain rules, regulations or guidelines of operators? (Wash Trading, Wallets collusion, Etc.)

### Leverage Illiquid Assets

Can a smart contract be created to hold NFT‚Äôs as collateral and lend based on the escrow?&#x20;

### Analytical tools&#x20;

Tools to send instantaneous alerts on ‚Äòhigh ROI‚Äô wallet movements or ‚Äòwhale‚Äô movements to subscribers; or a ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù tool to track wallets that have a higher propensity to win than average.

### Transferable Bets

Got a long shot bet you want to gift to a friend? How can you fully transfer ownership of an order to send it to another wallet?

### NFT Betslip

Your first bet, that big win, the crazy last-minute loss, sometimes you want the betslip for prosperity. How can you take key information from an order and save your betting memories forever?
