# Privacy Notice

Last Updated: 26 October 2023

Please read this Privacy Notice carefully and make sure that you fully understand its contents

This Privacy Notice is designed to help you understand how the Monaco Protocol Foundation, a Gibraltar Foundation, (“Monaco Protocol”, “we”, “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, processes, and shares your personal information, and but also how you can access, update or otherwise take control of your personal information and exercise your privacy rights. This Privacy Notice is subject as well to our [Terms of Service](https://docs.monacoprotocol.xyz/readme/terms-of-service).

Introduction.

No matter where you are in the world, where you reside, where your citizenship lies, or where your data comes from, Monaco Protocol strives to offer the same high standards of privacy protection to all individuals that use, visit and/or access any part of our website, which includes any website that links back to this Privacy Notice in its footer (“Site”), and/or utilize any services accessed through the Site (“Services”). For this reason, we collect and use personal data/information only as needed to deliver our Site and Services to you, and to communicate with you about the same, or as you have requested (collectively, hereafter for convenience referred to as our “Services”), and, always, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Notice.&#x20;

If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about our Privacy Notice, or how we handle your personal data, you may contact us by email at [hello@monacoprotocol.xyz](http://hello@monacoprotocol.xyz). If there are any capitalized terms in this Privacy Notice that are not defined, then those terms will have the meaning defined in our Terms of Service.

About our Services and the blockchain.

Our Services may facilitate interaction with certain decentralized cryptographic protocols like blockchains and with third party built applications that exist on these protocols. If you participate in our Services relating to the creation and management of digital assets, smart contracts will be employed that necessarily collect information, such as your digital wallet address (which some legal jurisdictions may consider personal information), and that information will be stored on a public blockchain that we do not control. A smart contract is computer code that automatically processes events when certain conditions are met; for example, when a transaction is conducted to add a token to a digital wallet, a smart contract would automatically execute the proposed action. In these situations, your personal information, such as a digital wallet address, will be stored on that blockchain through the execution of a smart contract and that personal information may not be able to be modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain.

What information we collect, how we collect it, and why.

Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you:

* create an Account and utilize our Services (ex: including name, address, government identification);
* As a condition to using our Services, we will ask you to share your general geolocation so we can ensure that we are authorized to provide the Services to you in your location;
* contact or otherwise request assistance from our customer support team (ex: email address, phone number, voice recordings);
* complete contact forms, subscribe to blogs or forums, or otherwise request newsletters or other information from us (ex: email); or
* participate in contests, surveys, or other marketing or promotional events and activities we promote that might require information about you.

However, we also collect additional information as necessary to lawfully and properly deliver the Services and/or to ensure necessary and optimal performance of the Services. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time).\
\
‍Cookies and similar technologies. Our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, such as links clicked, pages viewed, and Services utilized. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with our Services and Site features, or third-party features, such as social media plugins, contained within the Services; Internet Protocol (IP) address (for example, to determine your language preference; location, browser type and settings; the date and time the Services were used; device type and settings; operating system used; application IDs, unique device identifiers; and error data). These technologies also automatically collect data to measure website performance and improve our systems, including metadata, log files, page load time, server response time to optimize DNS resolution, network routing and server configurations. We use this information to understand how visitors to our websites are using them and which pages and features of the websites are most popular. This helps us understand how we can improve our websites and track performance of our advertisements. In addition, we use tracking technologies to help improve the navigation experience on our websites. We don’t sell this information to third parties.&#x20;

\
Third Party and Publicly Available Sources. Not all the personal information we hold about you will always come directly from you. We may also collect information from third parties such as our partners, service providers and publicly available websites (i.e. social media platforms), to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations, offer Services we think may be of interest, to help us maintain data accuracy and provide and enhance the Services. We may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and offer services that may be of interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.\
\
How we utilize information.&#x20;

We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you utilize, or (3) as we might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:\
\
‍Notice Regarding Use of the Blockchain. Aspects of our Services may be hosted on or interact with the blockchain. Where you use aspects of our Services that are hosted on or interact with the blockchain, information about your interactions and/or transactions will be provided to the applicable blockchain network and may be accessible to third parties due to the nature of the blockchain protocol.

Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services. We collect various information relating to your use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilize this information to:

* Deliver, improve and optimize the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications)
* Diagnose problems with and identify any security and compliance risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services
* Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems

Where possible, data collected for the purposes above is aggregated, or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal information (the number of individuals utilizing the Services for any period of time or on any individual date, for example).\
\
Sharing with trusted third parties. First things first: we do not sell your personal information. We also do not allow any personal information to be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes (except in cases where you explicitly request or provide consent for us to do so, such as at a conference when you direct us to share your information with a sponsor). We may share your personal information with affiliated companies within our Monaco Protocol family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as:

* Serving advertisements (more on this topic below)
* Conducting contests, promotions or surveys
* Performing analysis of our Services, customer demographics, and sentiment
* Communicating with you, such as by way of email or survey delivery
* Customer relationship management
* Security, risk management and compliance
* Recruiting support and related services.

These third parties (and any subcontractors they may be permitted to use) have agreed not to share, use or retain your personal information for any purpose other than as necessary for the provision of Services.\
\
We will also disclose your information to third parties:

* in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets (whether a result of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise), in which case we will disclose your data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; or
* if we sell, buy, merge, are acquired by, or partner with other companies or businesses, or sell some or all of our assets. In such transactions, your information may be among the transferred assets.

Advertisements. We may use personal information to tailor and provide you with content and advertisements. We may provide you with these materials as permitted by applicable law. Some of the ways we market to you include email campaigns or custom audiences advertising. If you have any questions about our marketing practices, you may contact us at any time as set forth in “Contact Us” below.\
\
‍Communicating with you. We may contact you directly or through a third party service provider regarding Services you utilize, such as necessary to deliver transactional or Services related communications. We may also contact you with offers for additional services we think you’ll find valuable if you give us consent, or where allowed to contact you based on legitimate interests. You don’t need to provide consent as a condition to utilize our Services. These contacts may include:

* Email
* Text (SMS) messages
* Telephone calls
* Messenger applications (e.g. WhatsApp, etc.)
* Automated phone calls or text messages.

You may also update your subscription preferences with respect to receiving communications from us and/or our partners by emailing us at [hello@monacoprotocol.xyz](http://hello@monacoprotocol.xyz) at any time, or via controls contained within the communications themselves (e.g., “utilizing “unsubscribe” links within an email). If we collect information from you in connection with a co-branded offer, it will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies. In addition, it will describe any options you have regarding the use and/or sharing of your personal information with a co-branded partner, as well as how to exercise those options. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites. Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit. If you believe that anyone has provided us with your personal information and you would like to request that it be removed from our database, please contact us at [hello@monacoprotocol.xyz](http://hello@monacoprotocol.xyz).\
‍\
Transfer of personal information abroad. Monaco Protocol Foundation is a Foundation formed and registered in Gibraltar, but with services, operations, related entities, and servers located in countries and regions outside of Gibraltar, including in the British Virgin Islands, Panama and the EU, UK and U.S.. If you utilize our Services from a country other than the country where our servers are located, your personal information may be transferred across international borders, which will only be done when necessary for the performance of our contract with you, when we have your consent to do so, for our own legitimate interests or subject to the appropriate standard contractual clauses. Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.\
\
‍Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical. To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process.&#x20;

How we secure, store and retain your data.

We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. We retain personal information for as long as required to engage in the uses described in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the following:

* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our Services);
* Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to maintain records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to the enforcement of our agreements, the resolution of disputes, and applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigation).
