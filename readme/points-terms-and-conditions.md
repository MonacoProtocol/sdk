# Points Terms and Conditions

Last Updated: 26 October 2023

PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. BY PARTICIPATING IN THE POINTS PROGRAM, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE POINTS PROGRAM.

General Application of Terms; Privacy

These Terms and Conditions (these “Points Terms”) apply to any access to and/or participation in the Monaco Protocol Points Program (the “Points Program”) existing now or in the future, which also includes, only to the extent necessary to govern your participation in the Points Program, the then-current Monaco Protocol Terms of Service and Privacy Notice (collectively, the “Monaco Protocol Terms”). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the respective meanings given to them in the Monaco Protocol Terms. If these Points Terms are inconsistent with any part of the Monaco Protocol Terms, these Points Terms will govern your participation in the Points Program.&#x20;

The Points Program is offered at the sole discretion of the Monaco Protocol. Rules, terms, conditions, benefits, rewards or points may be modified at any time by the Monaco Protocol with or without notice. Such changes may affect previously earned points.

Please read the Monaco Protocol Terms carefully to understand how the Monaco Protocol collects, uses and discloses information about its customers. These Points Terms do not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with the Monaco Protocol for other products and services, or the terms or conditions of any other promotional offers or programs conducted by the Monaco Protocol outside the context of the Points Program.

Eligibility

The Points Program is open to individuals who can access the Services and comply with the Monaco Protocol Terms legally within their jurisdiction of residence. The Monaco Protocol reserves the right to terminate and disqualify you at any time from participating in the Points Program if you do not comply with these Points Terms or any other part of the Monaco Protocol Terms.

How to Earn via the Points Program

Eligible participants can earn points for certain qualifying actions conducted with Monaco Protocol (“Points”) beginning as of 12:00am UTC as of 1 July 2023 (the “Launch”). Points will not be awarded for transactions occurring prior to the Launch.&#x20;

Monaco Points will accrue to wallets and apps that are parties to a trade. Three allocations of Monaco Points will be calculated for every trade. For any given trade the total traded volume is the sum of backer's matched liability and the sum of layer's matched liability in USDT / USDC.

* If a wallet provided initial liquidity without immediately being matched they are “Makers”
* If a wallet matches against liquidity that is already available they are “Takers”
* Makers will receive 6 points for every 1 USDT/C that is matched.
* Takers will receive 4 points for every 1 USDT/C that is matched
* dApps that facilitate either maker or taker order placement will receive 2 points for matched dollar that goes through their application.

For example, if ‘App Xchange’ User 1 utilizes a wallet to place a $5k USDT lay order at 2.0 that is unmatched (Maker), and ‘App Xchange’ User 2 utilzes a wallet to place a $5k USDT back order at 2.0 taking that liquidity (Taker), there will be a total of $10k traded volume in this trade. In such example:

* User 1 (Maker) will receive 30,000 Monaco Points
* User 2 (Taker) will receive 20,000 Monaco Points
* App Xchange (dApp) will receive 20,000 Monaco Points
*
  * Note if only one of the users was an App Xchange user, then the App Xchange dApp would receive 10,000 Monaco Points instead of 20,000.

The Points Program may be subject to additional terms, conditions, restrictions or limitations, which may be added to these Points Terms from time to time.

Tracking Points

Participants in the Points Program can view and track qualifying transactions and available Points at [https://www.monacoprotocol.xyz/monacopoints](https://www.monacoprotocol.xyz/monacopoints).&#x20;

Special Offers

The Monaco Protocol may from time to time in its sole discretion make available to participants in the Points Program the opportunity to earn additional points through special offers, challenges, bonuses, or other promotions. The terms and conditions applicable to any such special offers will be determined by the Monaco Protocol in its sole discretion and communicated to participants in conjunction with any such offers. Because any terms and conditions associated with any special offers may be different from or in addition to provisions of these Points Terms, you should read any such special offer terms and conditions carefully before participating in any special offer as the terms of the special offer will govern to the extent of any inconsistency with these Points Terms.&#x20;

Limitations, Restrictions, and Other Terms

The Monaco Protocol’s determinations of participant eligibility or any questions or disputes arising under the Points Program, these Points Terms, or any other the Monaco Protocol rules or restrictions shall be final and binding and not subject to challenge or appeal.

Unless otherwise specified, any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to our terms, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. If we change or modify these Points Terms, we will revise the “last updated” date located at the top of these Points Terms. If you continue to participate in the Points Program by earning Points, using Points, or otherwise participating in the program in any way after a change to these Points Terms, you will be deemed to have read, understood, and unconditionally consented and agreed to such changes; therefore, you should review these Points Terms and applicable policies and FAQs frequently to understand the terms and conditions that apply to the Points Program.
