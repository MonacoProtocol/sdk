# Roadmap

## Recently Completed ‚úÖ

- **SOL recovery with account closures:** Return rent to the wallet that opened the account (order, market position, matching pools etc)
- **Market authority lockdown:** Allow only the market authority the ability to manage their own markets
- **Ability to void a market:** Return all funds to their original wallet and mark the market as voided
- **In-play markets with bet delay:** Cancel all unmatched orders on event start and allow orders to be taken until market lock, with a specified matching delay
- **Operator and protocol fees:** Ability to set a % commission on winning market positions

## Coming Soon ‚öíÔ∏è 

- **Events Service v1:** New protocol to store event data (Team Red vs Team Blue) to link to markets
- **Additional market types:** Ability for operators to create more than 4 market types linked to a single event account
- **Matching optimisations:** Matching orders on creation and improving wallet risk management
- **Operational cost reductions:** Reduce rent overhead for creating and managing markets
- **Client order management optimisations:** Optimally reduce on-chain requests when creating and cancelling orders
- **Instruction builder in the client:** Ability to send multiple creation and cancel instructions in the same transaction
- **Trustless cranks:** Ability for anyone to operate a crank

## Later this year üìù

- **Cancel unmatched orders on market lock:** When a market locks, return unused funds to wallets rather than waiting for market settlement
- **API tooling for programmatic traders:** Caching API level for market data to avoid repeat RPC requests
- **User cost reductions:** Reduced accounts used in order creation/management and gasless transactions
- **Data feed integration:** Oracles for event and market creation leading to automated settlement
