## Introduction

The Monaco Protocol is a decentralized betting engine that offers global liquidity on prediction markets. It is the key infrastructure needed to offer exchange-based and prediction-book applications, allowing operators to focus on incredible user experiences rather than paying for access to traditional black-box iGaming platforms.

### What The Monaco Protocol Gives You

* Global liquidity - operators can share liquidity not fight for fragments. 
* Fully non-custodial.
* Single outcome binary markets.
* Best-price matching.
* Partial matching.
* Order cancellation on unmatched amounts.
* Smart risk management - unmatched risk can be used to fulfil new orders.
* Inplay betting with betting delay.
* Settlement straight to the winning wallet.
* Every release is fully audited by [sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/).
  * Each audit is publicly available at https://github.com/MonacoProtocol/protocol/tree/main/audit/sec3/
* Ability to charge product commission without impacting low-fee promises.
* Regular improvements in the protocol, tooling and the whole Monaco Protocol ecosystems.
* Basically all the benefits of an open-source, decentralized, ready-to-use, betting engine!

### Leveraging the Power of Solana

* Solana has an extremely innovative builders ecosystem that can flip the script when it comes to "how things are always done".
* The stability and throughput of the chain keeps on improving even as it on-boards more users.
* With a theoretical TPS of 50,000/s Solana offers the necessary speeds for a true exchange UX.
* Low fees mean you're paying fractions of a cent rather than more than your bet is worth on transactions.
* Counter-party risk is eliminated thanks to funds being managed by the fully-audited protocol.
