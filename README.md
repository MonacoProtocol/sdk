# Introduction

The Monaco Protocol is a decentralized liquidity network for exchange-based applications built on the Solana blockchain. It serves as crucial infrastructure upon which third-party front-end applications for wagering on binary outcome events can be built while accessing a shared liquidity pool.

## Why is the Monaco Protocol useful?

- The Monaco Protocol streamlines the wagering process.
- It helps provide greater liquidity for participants, reduce spreads, and offer lower prices.
- It lowers the take rates of institutions and middlemen.
- It reduces settlement times, increases transparency, and improves capital efficiency.

## Why Solana?

- High throughput and low costs are key pillars for any exchange-based mechanism, they are the foundation for building amazing user experiences.
- The Solana blockchain offers theoretical TPS speeds of up to 50,000/second with costs of a fraction of a cent.
- By building on the Solana blockchain, the Monaco Protocol delivers high speeds and low transaction costs while eliminating counter-party risk.

## Is the Protocol audited?

- The protocol has been audited by [sec3](https://www.sec3.dev/).
- The full report is available [right here](media/pdf/sec3_audit_the_monaco_protocol_nov_2022.pdf).
