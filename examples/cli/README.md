# Getting Started

This repository contains a solana wallet keypair located in [/wallet/example.json](./wallet/example.json) in order to run the example scripts with minimal setup. Please be aware that this keypair is public and should never be used on `Mainnet`. Never include a keypair in your own repository.

The publicKey for this wallet is `5BZWY6XWPxuWFxs2jagkmUkCoBWmJ6c4YEArr83hYBWk`

To aid testing matching orders, a secondary wallet is included [/wallet/example_secondary.json](./wallet/example_secondary.json).

The publicKey for this wallet is `GJFYdSWwcVzpmAQastTpN8j16EKLUtC7mGvqeE5gszL4`

:warning: As a reminder, these wallet keyPairs are stored within the repository for educational purposes only. Never include a keypair in your own repository. :warning:

These examples make use of the [anchor](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor) provider set on your environment, please note that the `ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL` in the example is the public solana RPC node for Devnet. This node should be used sparingly and is subject to rate-limiting. If you are going to make multiple requests, please consider using your own node.

```
npm install
export ANCHOR_WALLET=./wallet/example.json
export ANCHOR_PROVIDER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
```

```
export ANCHOR_WALLET=./wallet/example_secondary.json
```

- All example scripts have been added to the [package.json](package.json) for execution, to list them - `npm run`
- Where publicKeys are needs for scripts, examples have been provided however there is no guarantee the key links to valid accounts
  - For example in [GetMarketsByEvent](src/get_markets_by_event.ts), the eventAccountPk may not have a market associated with it
- [PlaceForOrder](src/place_for_order.ts) requires an open market and for the example wallet to have enough funds (SOL for tnx and the mintToken of the market)

## Match Orders & View Trades

To get a matching order and view trade accounts (trade accounts contain the details for matched orders), run the following against the same market:

```
export ANCHOR_WALLET=./wallet/example.json
npm run placeForOrder
```

```
export ANCHOR_WALLET=./wallet/example_secondary.json
npm run placeAgainstOrder
```

```
npm run getTradesForMarket
```
