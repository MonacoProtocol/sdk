# Getting Started - RPC Node

With any of the examples, you will need an RPC node in order to make requests to the protocol. You can read more about the RPC infrastructure on https://solana.com/rpc. There are many services available (listed on the solana RPC page) so pick one that suits your needs, but one that is easy to set up and offers a free tier is https://www.helius.dev/:

- Navigate to https://www.helius.dev/
- Select `Launch Dev Portal`
- Sign in with your preferred choice between:
  - A solana wallet
  - Github
  - Google
- Select `Generate Helius API Key`
- On https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard/app you'll then see your `Helius RPC URLs` for both `mainnet` and `devnet`
