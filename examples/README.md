There are many services available (listed on the solana RPC page) so pick one that suits your needs. Two you may wish to consider:

## Helius

- Select `Launch Dev Portal`
- Sign in with your preferred choice between:
  - A solana wallet
  - Github
  - Google
- Select `Generate Helius API Key`
- On https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard/app you'll then see your `Helius RPC URLs` for both `mainnet` and `devnet`

- Select `Get API Key`
- Sign in with your preferred choice between:
